# C++ Array Problems Collection

This repository contains solutions to a wide range of **array-based problems** in C++. Each file solves a specific problem that is commonly asked in coding interviews, competitive programming contests, and DSA practice sessions.

## üìÅ File Descriptions

| Filename                             | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `2_sum_problem.cpp`                 | Finds two numbers in an array that sum up to a target value. |
| `S_largest.cpp`                     | Finds the second largest element in the array. |
| `hello.cpp`                         | Basic C++ starter file for testing and experimentation. |
| `largest.cpp`                       | Finds the largest element in the array. |
| `leads_in_the_array.cpp`           | Prints leaders in the array (elements greater than all elements to their right). |
| `longest_subarray_sum_k.cpp`       | Finds the longest subarray with a given sum `k`. |
| `longest_subarray_with_sum_K_2.cpp`| Another optimized version of longest subarray with sum `k`. |
| `majority_element_n2.cpp`          | Finds the majority element in the array (appears more than n/2 times). |
| `maxi_one.cpp`                      | Maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array. |
| `maximum_product_subarray.cpp`     | Finds the maximum product of a contiguous subarray. |
| `maximum_subarray_sum.cpp`         | Implements Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum. |
| `merge_overlapping_subinterval.cpp`| Merges overlapping intervals in a set of intervals. |
| `missing_no.cpp`                   | Finds the missing number in a sequence of consecutive integers. |
| `next_permutation.cpp`             | Computes the next lexicographical permutation of the given array. |
| `rearrange_pos_neg.cpp`            | Rearranges positive and negative numbers alternatively. |
| `single_element.cpp`               | Finds the element that appears only once when all others appear twice. |
| `sort_0_1_2_Dutch_National_Flag.cpp`| Sorts an array with 0s, 1s, and 2s using the Dutch National Flag algorithm. |
| `sorted.cpp`                       | Checks if the array is sorted in ascending order. |
| `three_sum.cpp`                    | Finds all triplets that sum up to a target value (like the 3-Sum problem). |
| `zero_end.cpp`                     | Moves all zeroes in the array to the end, preserving the order of other elements. |
